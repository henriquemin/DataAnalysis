-- Market Basket Analysis
 When doing a market basket analysis or mining for association rules, the first step is often formatting the data to aggregate each transaction into a single record. This can be challenging for your laptop, but your data warehouse is designed to crunch this data efficiently.

Typical transaction data:

SALESORDERNUMBER	CUSTOMERKEY	ENGLISHPRODUCTNAME	LISTPRICE	WEIGHT	ORDERDATE
SO51247	11249	Mountain-200 Black	2294.99	23.77	1/1/2013
SO51247	11249	Water Bottle - 30 oz.	4.99		1/1/2013
SO51247	11249	Mountain Bottle Cage	9.99		1/1/2013
SO51246	25625	Sport-100 Helmet	34.99		12/31/2012
SO51246	25625	Water Bottle - 30 oz.	4.99		12/31/2012
SO51246	25625	Road Bottle Cage	8.99		12/31/2012
SO51246	25625	Touring-1000 Blue	2384.07	25.42	12/31/2012

-- Time-Series Aggregations
 

Time series aggregations are not only used by data scientists but theyâ€™re used for analytics as well. What makes them difficult is that window functions require the data to be formatted correctly.

For example, if you want to calculate the average sales amount in the past 14 days, window functions require you to have all sales data broken up into one row per day. Unfortunately, anyone who has worked with sales data before knows that it is usually stored at the transaction level. This is where time-series aggregation comes in handy. You can create aggregated, historical metrics without reformatting the entire dataset. It also comes in handy if we want to add multiple metrics at one time:

Average sales in the past 14 days
Biggest purchase in last 6 months
Count Distinct product types in last 90 days
If you wanted to use window functions, each metric would need to be built independently with several steps.

A better way to handle this, is to use common table expressions (CTEs) to define each of the historical windows, pre-aggregated.

For example:

Transaction ID	Customer ID	Product Type	Purchase Amt	Transaction Date
65432	101	Grocery	101.14	2022-03-01
65493	101	Grocery	98.45	2022-04-30
65494	101	Automotive	239.98	2022-05-01
66789	101	Grocery	86.55	2022-05-22
66981	101	Pharmacy	14	2022-06-15
67145	101	Grocery	93.12	2022-06-22
